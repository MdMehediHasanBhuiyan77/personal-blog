        <p id="about-me-para">I am an allround web developer. I am a senior <br> programmer with good knowledge of
            front-end <br>
            techniques. I love structure and order and I also stand for <br> quality. I love spending time on fixing
            little
            details and <br> optimizing web apps. Also I like working in a team, you'll <br> learn faster and much more.
            As the
            saying goes: 'two <br> heads are better than one'.</p>
